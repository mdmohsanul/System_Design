# WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

- It is standard created by W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) that defines how to make web application or websites accessible to everyone, including person having disabilities.

# WCAG is structured with four pillars (POUR)

1. Percivabel - User must see or hear your content
- Provide alt text
- maintain color contrast
- Provide captions for videos

2. Operable - User must be able to use the interface
- keyboard control
- Avoid auto play audio and video

3. Understandable - Content and UI must easy to understand
- Error message clearly state the issue
- Consistent design patterns
- Predictable navigation

4. Robust - Content must work with assistive tech
- Semantic HTML
- Correct ARIA roles

# WCAG 2.2 (2023) — latest, adds more usability rules

# WCAG Conformance Levels

Each guideline has 3 levels:

Level A → Minimum accessibility
Level AA → Industry standard (most companies aim for this)
Level AAA → Highest level, rarely fully required

# If you pass WCAG AA, your website is considered accessible for most users.
